# Refactor Start

This is the entry point for refactoring a Quint specification.
It runs the same procedure as `/refactor:orchestrate`. See that command for full documentation.

Running `/refactor:start` will:
1. Ask you to describe the changes you want to make in plain language
2. Analyze the spec and produce a refactor plan
3. Apply the changes with feedback loops and user approval gates
4. Validate the result
