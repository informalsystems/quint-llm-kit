# Verify Start

This is an alias for `/verify:generate-witness`. Running `/verify:start` begins the verification workflow by generating witness scenarios — the natural first step after typechecking a spec.

Executing this command runs the same procedure as `/verify:generate-witness`. See that command for full documentation.
